    <h1>About myself</h1>
    <div>
        <p>I have been involved with the IT industry between 1978 to present</p>
        <p>My initial experience with IT was in Sydney Broadway (UTS - University of Technology Sydney), where I studied computer science.</p>

                <h2 class="">1979 to 1982</h2>
                <p class="text-lg md:text-sm lg:text-lg">
                I had a glimpse of the computer industry without a monitor. My programming had to be done using punch cards for the first few months and the results would be printed.
                Can you imagine debugging that !?<span class="text-2xl">ðŸ¤¯</span>

        <p>While I was learning computer science which included programming languages like COBOL and Fortran, it occurred to me that Australia was slightly behind in software technology.</p>
        <p>So I purchased some books and videos from America to learn C and C++, while Australian were still mostly using COBOL. This lead to a fairly successful career in IT.</p>

                <h2>Mid 80s</h2>
                <p>Between Tandy 1000, Commodore 64 and the like, IBM released the XT Computer with a monitor !<span class="text-2xl">ðŸ˜Ž</span></p>
                <p>It was assumed back then that an "IT professional" has to know everything about the vast computer industry, and so to satisfy this insane myth, I changed my job skill to "everything about IT"</p>
                <p>Ergo, knowing DOS, UNIX, Network technologies, BBS, Debug and programming languages was essential.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3 class="my-2">This included but not limited to:</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
                <li>Network installation from peer-to-peer to Token Ring and later dropped it because the standards manual became huge (for a cable!).</li>
                <li>Building computers</li>
                <li>Software Development, especially custom accounting software before the days of MYOB and the such.</li>
                <li>Developing BOM (Bill of Materials) software for manufacturers</li>
                <li>Bulletin Board System Software (BBS), back in the snail mail era. This included having my own and been a **sysop** :)</li>
                <li>and then came the internet, a whole new learning curve.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Basically I started in computers in 1978, later to learn at UTS using punch cards to programme COBOL, because there were no monitors, to today, where a computer and monitor can carried in your hand, in the form of a mobile ðŸ˜œ
