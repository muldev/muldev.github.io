    <h1>About myself</h1>
    <div class="lg:w-2/3 md:w-4/5">
        <p>I have been involved with the IT industry between 1978 to present</p>
        <p>My initial experience with IT was in Sydney Broadway (UTS - University of Technology Sydney), where I studied computer science.</p>

                <p class="md:text-sm lg:text-lg">
                I had a glimpse of the computer industry that had no monitors, just printers. My programming had to be done using punch cards for the first few months and the results would be printed.
                Can you imagine debugging that !?<span class="text-2xl">ü§Ø</span>

        <p>While I was learning computer science which included programming languages like COBOL and Fortran, it occurred to me that Australia was slightly behind in software technology.</p>
        <p>So I purchased some books and videos from America to learn C and C++, meanwhile Australian's were still mostly using COBOL. This lead to a fairly successful career in IT.</p>

                <h2>Mid 80s</h2>
                <p>Between Tandy 1000, Commodore 64 and the like, IBM released the XT Computer with a monitor !<span class="text-2xl">üòé</span></p>
                <p>It was assumed back then that an "IT professional" has to know everything about the vast computer industry, and so to satisfy this insane myth, I changed my job skill to "everything about IT"</p>
                <p>Ergo, knowing DOS, UNIX, Network technologies, BBS, Debug and programming languages was essential.</p>

            <h3 class="my-2">This included but not limited to:</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
                <li class="my-2">Network installation from peer-to-peer to Token Ring and later dropped it because the standards manual became huge (for a cable! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).</li>
                <li class="my-2">Building computers</li>
                <li class="my-2">Software Development, especially custom accounting software before the days of MYOB and the such.</li>
                <li class="my-2">Developing BOM (Bill of Materials) software for manufacturers</li>
                <li class="my-2">Bulletin Board System Software (BBS), back in the snail mail era. This included having my own and been a **sysop** üëÄ</li>
                <li class="my-2">and then came the internet, a whole new learning curve.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To summarize,  I started in computers in 1978, later to learn at UTS using punch cards to programme COBOL, because there were no monitors. Today a computer and monitor can be carried in your hand, in the form of a mobile üòú
