    <h1>About myself</h1>
    <div class="lg:w-2/3 md:w-4/5">
        <p>I have been toiling in the IT industry between 1978 to present</p>
        <p>My initial experience with IT was in Sydney Broadway (UTS - University of Technology Sydney), where I studied computer science.</p>

                <p class="md:text-sm lg:text-lg">
                I had a glimpse of the computer industry that had no monitors, just printers. For the first few months my programming had to be done using punch cards and the results would be printed.
                Can you imagine debugging that !?<span class="text-2xl">ü§Ø</span>

        <p>While I was learning computer science which included programming languages like COBOL and Fortran, it occurred to me that Australia was slightly behind in software technology.</p>
        <p>So I purchased some books and videos from America to learn C and C++, which lead to a fairly successful career in IT software development. Meanwhile Australian's were still mostly using COBOL,  </p>

                <p>Between Tandy 1000, Commodore 64 and the like, IBM released the XT Computer with a monitor !<span class="text-2xl">üòé</span></p>
                <p>It was assumed back then that an "IT professional" has to know everything about the vast computer industry, and so to satisfy this insane myth, I changed my job skill to "everything about IT"</p>
                <p>Ergo, knowing DOS, UNIX, Network technologies, BBS, Debug and programming languages was essential.</p>

                <li class="my-2">and then came the internet, a whole new learning curve.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I knew that networking was a key aspect of the IT infrastructure, so I learnt it all, LANtastic, Novell, Microsoft, UNIX, Linux.
                I connected offices between New Zealand and Australia smoothly, so that a remote server was easily accessible to a local user.
            </p>
            <p>In the mid 90s, I found a server-side program called ColdFusion known as CFML, developed by Allaire Corporation later owned by Macromedia and now owned by Adobe.
                This facilitated connection to a database and was well known for commercial rapid web-application development platform.
            </p>
            <p>Early in the year 2000, I was contracted to create a website for live-streaming a casino, owned by Australian's and hosted in Cyprus.
                Considering video streaming was difficult to accomplish back then, It was an interesting project that I took on with confidence.
                I started the design in ColdFusion, however midway PHP was released and the combination of PHP and Java improved performance.
            </p>
            <p>Most of my contracts dealt with Manufacturers. Out of most businesses I find manufacturing interesting to work with.
                Rather than inventory, sales and marketing there is so much more to work with. Job orders, Bill of Materials, CAM sofware   </p>
            <p>
                <span class="text-xl">To summarize,</span>  I started in computers in 1978, later to learn at UTS using punch cards to programme COBOL,
                because there were no monitors, and later self-taught in C, C++ and C sharp.

            <div class="framed text-xl">Presently I develop and design websites only. I have a team of freelance developers that help out with larger projects.
                I mainly work with PHP and use a framework called
