                <p class="text-lg">Your opportunity to draw in a potential customer relies on your website to appeal to them within roughly <span class="text-yellow-100"><b>15 seconds.</b></span></p>
                <p>If you haven’t generated interest within 15 seconds, then you probably aren’t going to.</p>
                <p>This is why it is important to have a high quality welcoming page that instantly grabs a visitors' attention.
                    having words like special, save and the like does not work.
                </p>
                <p>If someone is looking for Window tinting, you're more likely to capture their attention with "Long Lasting Tint" followed by interesting animation.
                    Just a few words that has an impact on decision-making.

                <h3 class="font-bold text-amber-700">Is that the only benefit ?</h3>
                <p class="text-lg">No, many self-served web designs lack articulation with CSS and designing forms.</p>
                <p>They become either too complex or impossible to work with. While a simple contact form should be easy to build,
                    as soon as you want to introduce something the automated system is not accustomed to it breaks,
                    sometimes leaving your website vulnerable to attacks because you found a workaround to make it work (a hack).</p>
                <p>After speaking to many customers about online web creation, most of them explained the same problem to me.
                    After spending hours trying to get their site to look a certain way, they needed help with reformatting the CSS</p>
                <p>In the end they never really got exactly what they wanted. One thing for sure they were too scared to tamper with the site anymore in case they broke it.</p>

                <p class="text-lg">Good question :)</p>
                <p> run this test below. We don't need your contact details, you can run it safely without us needing to track your progress,
                    The questionnaire will try to determine which is best for you, depending on your needs.
                    An example would be a couple of pages to advertise your business name does not need a custom built  website, unless of course you wanted to stand out.</p>
                <p>            At the end the questionnaire will calculate a price estimate, which you can print to compare quotes,
                    once again there is no obligation to register your details with us. We do not use annoying popups or trackers,
                    personally I find them intrusive.</p>
